## requirements:
    pip install setuptools


before building you need to get a kdg distribution

    you can find it at: 
    https://github.com/KrokodileGlue/kdg
    git clone it at the same directory of the README
    so you end up with a directory structure like: README pykdgsetup kdg
                                                                      ^contains makefile


this installs a virtual environement in the same directory so you don't mess your system's python installation, python >3.5 required

take a look at the scripts and use them to experiemnt with the module :)


supported functions at this stage:
    import pykdg
    match = pykdg.search(src, pat, opt)
    match.groups() : gives you number of groups
    match.group( n ) gives you the group at n
